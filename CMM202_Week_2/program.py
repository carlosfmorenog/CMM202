#%% First, lets create a menu with two options
# 1. enter your name
# 2. count the number of "a's" in your name and show it


#%% Then, we add the option "0" to exit the program

#%% Then, we add some complexity
# the name must have more than 2 characters
# if the user enters an invalid name, gets kicked out

#%% Finally, we give more robustness to our program
# a) option 2 cannot be selected without option 1 being selected first
# b) give three opportunities for the name before "kick out"
# c) Verify that the input in the main menu is a number
# if a number, print "invalid option"
# if not a number, print "invalid input"












#%% More ideas
# Add a third option that displays all the names that have been stored before
# and their corresponding "a" letter count
# if this option is selected before 1 and 2, print "empty"
# this option has to check that both 1 and 2 have been used before in that order
